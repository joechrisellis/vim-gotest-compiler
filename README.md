# `go test` compiler for Vim

Vim compiler for working with `go test`.

Most of the code here is copied from the fantastic
[fatih/vim-go](https://github.com/fatih/vim-go) plugin, which already sets
`errorformat` correctly. The license for this is therefore the same as vim-go
(see [`LICENSE`](./LICENSE)).

This is for peeps that just want the vanilla `:compiler` stuff. âœ¨
